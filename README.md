## Movie and a Dinner

Having to decide what to watch and what to eat can be exhausting after you get home from work. 
Allow your brain to relax and use our service Movie and a Dinner

Our robust website has access to over 10,000 movies that you can randomly access or filter at your choice.
The meal service randomly chooses a meal for you with a full ingredient list as well directions on how to prepare your meal.


This what you see when you start your dining experience
